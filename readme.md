# rude

a minimal x11 window manager

## features

- no workspaces, just endless space
- zoom out to see all your windows at once
- minimal and rude
- perfect for tiling window layouts by hand
- swmh support for compatibility with status bars and scripts
- written in less than 300 lines of c

## keybindings

- `super + left click`: move window
- `super + right click`: resize window
- `super + shift + left/right arrow`: scroll the infinite canvas
- `super + spacebar`: toggle zoom (see all windows / return to normal view)
- `super + q`: close window

## how to build

make sure you have `libx11-dev` installed, then:

```
gcc -O3 -o rude rude.c -lX11 -lm
```

## how to use

*rude has no real keybinds for terminals or anything, so use sxhkd or something.*


```
clone it
git clone https://github.com/getjared/rude.git
cd rude

build it with makefile
make
sudo make install
```

add ```exec rude``` to your `.xinitrc`:

then start x with `startx`

to completely shut it down i would suggest adding this as well to your ```.xinitrc```

```
setxkbmap -option terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp
```



## why. .

this is my own little project, not really meant for other people to actually use it, lol..
